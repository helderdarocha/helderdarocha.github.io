That's me! I am a nomadic multi-language programmer and researcher interested in many arts and sciences. In this blog I share ideas, thoughts, opinions about technology. I've been involved with Web technologies since the early 90s.

This blog is hosted in GitHub Pages and built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
