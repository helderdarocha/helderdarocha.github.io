That's me! I am a nomadic multi-language programmer and researcher interested in many arts and sciences. In this blog I share ideas, thoughts, opinions about technology.

This blog is hosted in GitHub Pages and built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). You can read about how I set it up in  [this post]().

I have several other sites but most are in Portuguese. At <http://www.argonavis.com.br> I advertise my courses and consulting services and also make several tutorials available for download (all in Portuguese). I also have a personal website at <http://www.helderdarocha.com.br>. In 2012 I started making detailed full-size pterosaur skeletons out of recycled foam, and I have a blog about that in English at <http://imaginosaurus.wordpress.com>.
