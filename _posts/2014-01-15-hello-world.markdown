Hi! Welcome to my blog. I hope to use this space to blog about technology and to share things I am researching or learning. I currently work as an independent consultant, programmer, technical writer and teacher, so every now and then I should have something interesting to post here.

I first started using computers to write games, and then for desktop publishing and graphics. That was in the early 90s. Then came the Web and back in 1996 I wrote a book on HTML & CSS, another one on JavaScript two years later, and then spent more than a decade programming in Java, writing about it and teaching. I have taught Java and Web technologies to thousands of students. I have a lot of stuff written in Portuguese, and almost nothing in English, so this blog might be a chance to change that.

I'm also trying to organize some of my course material, sample code, unfinished projects and upload everything to GitHub. I'm doing this mostly to organize my code and avoid duplicating my own work, but hopefully it will be of use to others as well.
